    A manufacturing company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The company earns \$40 profit per unit of Product A and \$50 profit per unit of Product B.

    **Production constraints:**
    - Labor: Each unit of A requires 2 hours, each unit of B requires 3 hours (100 hours available)
    - Materials: Each unit of A needs 4 kg, each unit of B needs 2 kg (120 kg available)
    - Capacity: Maximum 30 units of A and 25 units of B can be produced

    **Question:** How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize total profit?
  problem: |
    maximize 40*product_a + 50*product_b

    subject to:
        # Resource constraints
        2*product_a + 3*product_b <= 100  # Labor hours available

    A logistics company operates two warehouses and needs to supply three retail stores. Warehouse 1 has 200 units in stock, and Warehouse 2 has 300 units. The stores have the following demands: Store 1 needs 150 units, Store 2 needs 200 units, and Store 3 needs 150 units.

    **Shipping costs per unit:**
    - W1→S1: \$8, W1→S2: \$6, W1→S3: \$10
    - W2→S1: \$9, W2→S2: \$12, W2→S3: \$13

    A nutritionist is designing a cost-effective meal plan for a health center using four food items: bread (\$3), milk (\$2), cheese (\$4), and potato (\$1) per serving.

    **Nutritional content per serving:**
    - Bread: 4 calories, 2g protein, 2 vitamin units
    - Milk: 8 calories, 12g protein, 3 vitamin units
    - Cheese: 2 calories, 10g protein, 8 vitamin units
    - Potato: 2 calories, 4g protein, 2 vitamin units

    **Daily requirements:** minimum 2000 calories, 55g protein, 800 vitamin units

    **Question:** How many servings of each food should be included in the daily meal plan to meet all nutritional requirements at minimum cost?

    An investment management firm has \$1,000,000 to allocate across three projects with different annual return rates: Project A offers 12% returns, Project B offers 15% returns, and Project C offers 18% returns.

    **Investment constraints:**
    - Total budget: \$1,000,000 maximum available
    - Risk management: 0.6A + 0.8B + 0.9C <= \$750,000 (weighted risk limit)
